Modeling and Validation for Regression Analysis

This project focuses on the preprocessing, feature selection, and validation of regression models to enhance predictive accuracy. Key steps and methodologies include:

Preprocessing: Removal of outliers and null values, one-hot encoding, and scaling of numeric features.
Feature Selection: Identified and retained features with high correlation to the target variable while addressing collinearity issues.
Algorithm Evaluation: Developed and tuned multiple regression models, including:
Linear Regression (+32% accuracy improvement with feature selection).
Polynomial Regression (best performance with degree 2).
Decision Tree Regression (optimal depth of 6).
k-Nearest Neighbors (best result with 12 neighbors).
Cross-Validation: Ensured model robustness and avoided overfitting.
Results demonstrate that models with feature selection and tuning outperformed baseline models, achieving significant accuracy improvements. The project highlights the importance of careful preprocessing and algorithm tuning in predictive modeling.
